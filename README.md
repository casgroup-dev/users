# Users microservice

This is the basic schema to create and code this microservice, feel
free to modify any part, but please keep the standards.

The Code Style is the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/)
and there is a package in the
dependencies called `standard` that is useful to to check the style
of your code and correct errors. I use
[WebStorm IDE from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
and you can set the settings to use the standard package
automatically and it highlights the errors.

**PLEASE MODIFY THIS README AND ADD THE API DOCS**.  
A recommendation is to use [swagger](https://editor.swagger.io/)
as documentation of the API.
